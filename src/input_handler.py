    Reads serial input from the Arduino and returns a tuple (dx, dy) representing
    the omnidirectional movement based on the sensor's tilt.
    
    Expected serial format:
      "button_state,roll_angle,pitch_angle,direction"
    For example: "1,1.10,0.24,STRAIGHT"
    
    We ignore the button state and textual direction. Instead, we use the roll and pitch
    angles (in degrees) to compute a movement vector.
    
    The first valid reading is used as the baseline (zero) value.
    A deadzone is applied so that small deviations around the zero don't produce movement.
    A tilt beyond the deadzone is scaled so that a tilt of max_angle (e.g. 30Â°) yields full movement (magnitude 1).
    
    Returns:
      (dx, dy) where dx and dy are floats between -1 and 1.
